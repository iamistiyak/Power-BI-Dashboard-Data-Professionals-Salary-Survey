# Power-BI-Dashboard-Data-Professionals-Salary-Survey


**Functionality:** This Power BI project aims to analyze the average 
salary trends of various data professionals from 2017 to 2021 
and forecast their average salaries up to 2026. The dataset, 
obtained from Data World in CSV format, serves as the 
foundation for this analysis. Key metrics include showcasing the 
salary trends, comparing the average salaries of different data 
professionals, and forecasting future salaries.
Visualizations play a crucial role in conveying the insights 
derived from the data. The project utilizes a variety of visual 
elements, such as line graphs to illustrate salary trends, tables to 
showcase required education, pie charts to represent 
certification requirements, gauge charts for average spending 
years, horizontal bar charts for salary comparisons, and tree 
maps to depict the number of survey takers from different 
countries.
Methodologically, linear regression models were employed 
to predict the average salaries of various data professionals. 
Additionally, the forecasting feature in Power BI was leveraged 
to project salary trends using line graphs.
Key findings and insights include the discerned trends in the 
average salaries of diverse data professionals, the forecasted 
average salaries until 2026, and the predictive accuracy 
achieved through the implementation of the linear regression 
model. This project not only provides a comprehensive analysis 
of salary dynamics in the data professional landscape but also 
offers a valuable forecasting tool for stakeholders in the field.<br><br>
